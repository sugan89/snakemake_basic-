MissingOutputException in rule plot in file C:\Users\ssivagur\Documents\snakemake_test\Snakefile, line 15:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/plot.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: new.csv)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
