MissingOutputException in rule process in file C:\Users\ssivagur\Documents\snakemake_test\Snakefile, line 8:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
C:/Users/ssivagur/Documents/snakemake_test/output/new.csv (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
